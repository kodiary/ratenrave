Kailali District is one of the most backward districts of Nepal with little infrastructure base and a poor state of educational facilities which is evident from the fact that prior to the establishment of KMC in 1980, most of the students of this region had to go to Kathmandu or to India for further studies beyond SLC. The absence of educational opportunities after SLC created an urgent social demand for establishment of a campus in the district. The people of Kailali thus took the initiative for the establishment of a campus. Consequently, Kailali Commerce Campus, which was later renamed as Kailali Multiple Campus, was established in 1980 as an affiliated Campus of Tribhuvan University. At the request of the people of Kailali, the Government of Nepal granted 27 bighas of land in eastern part of Dhangadhi town where the Campus premises are located at present. Financial and other resources required for the establishment of the Campus were raised locally.

Besides all these glorious gifts of creation, human beings need education to acquire a complete life. Only educated people can make their life successful and build a developed Nation. So every person needs education. This school is for Deaf children. There is a vast difference in the access of education between hearing and deaf. So deaf by birth, hard of hearing or late hearing loss can get education only through sign language. Education makes their living easier. So to provide education for deaf, two educated deaf persons started a school on 3rd December 1987 which was run in a room of Shreejana Youth Club in Pokhara. There were only 7 students and two teachers at that time. Today, only this school provides higher level education for the deaf in the country and region. The educational condition of Nepal is poor and under such circumstances, deaf schools are not found everywhere. The courses and textbooks are similar in the schools of hearing and deaf. But deaf students are taught by using sign language. Deaf students come to receive education in this school from different parts of Nepal. Every Nation has the responsibility to educate all children who are the future idol of that country but our country has not given more attention in the education of deaf children. This school runs from classes&#39; nursery to twelve. Tailoring and computer training classes are also available. This school is supported by government and also helped by Gandaki Association of the Deaf, Pokhara and some International organizations of deaf. It has its own school and hostel buildings. 147 students have hostel facilities and rest of the students attend their classes by school bus. School is always aiming with the wills and rights of the deaf education. During the operation of the school, it comes through various challenges and opportunities. We always remember the contributions made by various institutions or associations, individual as a pride. Its main motto is to provide education access for all deaf children of our country.

Twenty two years down the line, it has grown into one of the premier co-ed institutions in the country, with 1300 students and boasting a staff size of 170. In this present age where concerned parents are constantly seeking to send their children abroad for higher education, a need was felt to provide these parents with some solace in the form of a quality school in their midst. With over two decades of experience in the education field, Triyog feels matured enough to foray into the field of higher education. What further encouraged the School to step towards this direction is the success achieved by our students in their quest for higher education worldwide. The School regularly gets encouraging feedbacks from its ex-students who are scattered all over the world and we take pride in our studentsâ€™ achievement in different universities in UK, USA, Australia and India not to speak of back home. We, at Triyog, have always tried to spell the difference between mere education and â€˜qualityâ€™ education. Our effort lies in making a person educated rather than knowledgeable. We strive to extend knowledge beyond what is provided in the books towards building up curious, inquisitive, ethically and morally sound citizens who can become agents of social change in their country and learn to use their freedom judiciously.
